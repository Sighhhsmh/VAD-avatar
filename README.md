Fun Project idea i had as a programming newbie.


    Functionality:
        - VAD aka. Voice Activity Detection for animating mouth movement.
        - Mouse Position Tracking for a virtual mouse and animating head movement.
        - Decent amount of adjustability.
        - Works inside OBS 'Browser Source'.

    Contents:
        - Whole app is based on web DOM manipulation.
        - Made almost completely with JavaScript.
        - uses localstorage with liberty. [state changes are all stored using localstorage()]
